The good thing is that modern imaging technology allows us to further push the resolution to the level of these fine-scale structures in the visual cortex. 
The typical resolution of 3 tesla MRI scanners, such as the one we have in Graz, is around 3 mm.
However, scanners with higher magnetic field are becoming more and more popular, like the 7 or the 9.4 Tesla. And higher magnetic field allows to increase the spatial resolution to a submillimeter range.

## Accuracy vs. precision

What is the difference?

17

::: {.notes}

:::

## Accuracy vs. precision

Accuracy

How close the measurement is to ground truth
Relevant for accurately identifying neural structures

Precision

How reproducible the measurement is
Relevant for detecting statistically significant effects

18

::: {.notes}

:::

## Project 1

19

Research question: Is there a precision advantage in high-resolution MRI

## Project 1

Dataset

Cortical thickness was analyzed using FreeSurfer’s longitudinal processing stream
Each participant was processed twice: once at 1 mm3 and once at 0.6 mm3
Checkerboard effect was only quantified for 1mm-processed data

Your task for the presentation

Explain the experimental paradigm and the effects on cortical thickness found in the study at low resolution
Explain your research question
Make a suggestion on how you would compare the effects at low resoltuion and at high (“native”) resoltuion

## Problem with the current data:

27

Too little data per subject, too little data per condition order, inter-individual variability

## Project 1.3

Dataset

Same dataset as 1.1, but checkerboard stimulaiton is irrelevant
All four scans are aligned, averaged and analyzed as one
We will need to generate intermediate surfaces and do the voxel intensity sampling
