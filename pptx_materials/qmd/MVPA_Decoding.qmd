## Simplified example

After multiple trials, a classifier learns the differences in neural activity between the face and the vase trials:

Every time a new trial (the one it did not learn from) is presented, a classifier makes a binary decision about the trial type based on what it previously learned:

The classifier categorizes this as a face trial, and the researcher compares it against ground truth (actual subjectâ€™s response). If this procedure is repeated many times, you can determine classifier accuracy and compare it with chance level (50%) in our case
