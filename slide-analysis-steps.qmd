-   Single-subject - first level - fixed effects analysis (FFX)

-   Group - second-level - random effects analysis (RFX)

::: notes

This is equivalent to e.g. conducting many trials per subject to measure reaction time, and then compute a subject-specific mean per condition, after which you would perform the actual statistical inference

Multilevel modelling is also possible (for small datasets), but less frequent.
