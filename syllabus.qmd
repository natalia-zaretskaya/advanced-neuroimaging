*This practice-oriented seminar provides an introduction into the modern methods of MRI-based neuroimaging for cognitive neuroscience.\
It will take students through all stages of a functional MRI study:\
- planning and programming an experiment,\
- acquiring the data\
- data preprocessing\
- data analysis and interpretation\
In addition to theoretical input, the course will have a strong practical component. Students will first present their project ideas in class. After this, the class will select the best project, which will be implemented into a computer program. Together with the lecturer we will conduct an fMRI experiment with one volunteer. The students will get access to a server, and each person will go through all stages of data preprocessing and analysis.\
Open science practices in the field of neuroimaging will also be introduced.*
