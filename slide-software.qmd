::: notes
Preprocessing used to be integrated into the software used for the actual analysis. And there are many software for this. On this slide I just put a few of them. Each of them has a slightly different phylosophy behind it, but all of them do roughly the same thing, so at the end it should not matter much which of them you use.

One of the oldest ones are:

-   SPM – statistical parameteric mapping from UCL. It is a free MATLAB-based toolbox. However, it depends on the MATLAB licence, and has not been updated for a long time. The new update just came out which spans the gab from 2012 to 2025 [@tierney2025].

-   AFNI - from NIH

-   FSL from Oxford – a set of linux tools, also free and independent of MATLAB, which is an advantage, but requires Linux.

-   FreeSurfer/FSFAST form the Martinos center - it is Linux based, and was originally conceived as a tool for structural data analysis, but has an fMRI module

Historical software

-   broccolli, that can utilize GPU computing and can process the same dataset n times faster

With the awareness of open science, and with the trend towards reproducibility and transparency, and with the release of fMRIprep software, the preprocessing got detached from the actual data analysis.
