## Hemodynamic response function

![](images/clipboard-1679437843.png)

::: notes
This curve describes the measured signal in response to a brief stimulus.

The response is heavily delayed, and has a relatively complex temporal structure, described by the so called hemodynamic response function (HRF).

After just a brief stimulus that lasts less than a second, the response lasts for seconds. It has a delayed rise phase, a peak, and a subsequent undershoot. The fact that the response is so slow is the main constraint of the temporal resolution of fMRI. It constrains the kind of questions you can ask in your experiment and also puts some constraints on your experimental design.

## Neural activity and BOLD

![](images/clipboard-2104563483.png)

::: aside
BOLD signal correlates better with LFP than with MUA [@logothetis2001a]
:::

::: notes
LFP = Local Field Potentials (dendritic currents)

MUA = Multiunit Activity (action potentials)

SDF = Spike-density function (action potentials)
:::

## Image acquisition

![](images/clipboard-1936163497.png)

::: notes
The functional volume is usually acquired slice-by-slice; this is why when you are acquiring the data you see an image like this on the monitor. A functional sequence is characterized by the in-plane matrix size and resolution, as well as by the slice thickness.
:::

## Experimental design

![](images/clipboard-3076195966.png)

::: notes
In contrast to e.g. fNIRS, the BOLD-fMRI does not measure the deoxyhemoglobin concentration directly. It is a measure that is weighted by the deoxyhemoglobin concentration, but depends on many other factors like scanner, sequence, participant, and brain area.

This is why any measure of fMRI experiment has to contain at least two conditions, a baseline, and condition of interest. The activation is always computed relative to some baseline. For instance a checkerboard vs gray background, finger tapping versus rest; faces versus houses, etc. And a typical analysis will compare the BOLD signal during condition of interest with rest.

## A typical experiment

![](images/clipboard-2847001828.png)

::: notes
To help us better understand the analysis steps, let’s use an example. Let’s say we have conducted a classical experiment in the visual system, a flickering checkerboard. In this experiment, we want to find out which brain areas are active when subjects view a flickering checkerboard compared to when they view a gray background. We have shown to every volunteer a checkerboard for e.g. 20 second interleaved with a 20 s rest, and we will measure a whole brain volume every 2 seconds, for e.g. to minutes or so.

Matlab code to generate stimulus, BOLD and shifted BOLD X = \[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\]; bf = spm_get_bf; % indicated a tr of 2.5 Y = conv(X,bf.bf); Ye = Y+randn(size(Y)).\*0.2;
:::

## 4D dataset

![](images/clipboard-531340901.png)

::: notes
In a functional experiment we usually measure brain activity across the whole volume over extended periods of time, so it is comfortable to think about each functional dataset that we acquire as a 4D dataset, which consists of 3D brain volumes and time as a 4th dimension. This is how the data is typically stored.

A further important parameter is the repetition time (TR). It is the time passes between the acquisition times of two adjacent volumes.
:::

## Preprocessing

![](images/clipboard-3600520399.png)

::: aside
Summary of preprocessing steps [@esteban2018]
:::

::: notes
The data quality of modern scanners is typically good enough to skip this step, if your subject is compliant. But it is nevertheless very much advisable and is ALWAYS performed. We will therefore dedicate a whole session to preprocessing. See [course schedule](syllabus.qmd#tbl-schedule) for the date.
:::

## Analysis

-   Single-subject - first level - fixed effects analysis (FFX)

-   Group - second-level - random effects analysis (RFX)

::: notes
This is equivalent to e.g. conducting many trials per subject to measure reaction time, and then compute a subject-specific mean per condition, after which you would perform the actual statistical inference

Multilevel modelling is also possible (for small datasets), but less frequent.
:::

## Single-subject (first-level) analysis

Univariate/voxel-wise analysis

![](images/clipboard-3043522045.png)

Question: Which areas are activated by the flickering checkerboard?

::: notes
Remember that an image is 4d and consists of little 3D cubes called voxels, with the 4th dimension being time. A classical analysis is done over time for every voxel in the brain independently.
:::

## Stimulus function

![](images/clipboard-1888338078.png)

::: notes
Let’s recall our checkerboard experiment where participants viewed either a checkerboard or a gray screen. Let’s also create a function, called "stimulus function", which is one where the checkerboard was on, and zero where the checkerboard was off
:::

## Side-note on terminology

### Trial

Continuous presentation of 1 experimental condition, usually 1-20 seconds

### Run

Block of trials separated by interruption of a scanner acquisition, usually 5-10 minutes

### Session

Block of runs, separated by subject going out of the scanner and going in again, usually at least one day

## Voxel time course

![](images/clipboard-1165528043.png)

::: notes
Let’s now look at the time course of a voxel in the visual cortex. You see that it is noisy and delayed, but it kind of follows the stimulus.
:::

## Simplest analysis: temporal alignment

![](images/clipboard-62469843.png)

::: notes
The simplest analysis would be to realign the BOLD time course with the stimulus time course
:::

## Simplest analysis: statistical inference

![](images/clipboard-3483010198.png)

::: notes
Then labael each value according to when it was acquired, stimulus or baseline Collect two types of data points into two big piles and do a statistical comparison via a t-test
:::

## Simplest analysis: statistical map

![](images/clipboard-969426715.png)

::: notes
If you do it for every voxel, you can get a new volume, which consists of t-statistics
:::

## General Linear Model (GLM)

Multiple regression with ingredients:

-   Predictor(s): stimulus function convolved with the HRF (see [Buidling regressors])

-   Nuissance regressors

## General linear model

## Statistical inference in whole-brain analysis

![](images/clipboard-3973626449.png)

::: notes
How do we get from beta estimates to making statistical inference? As in a typical regression, beta estimate divided by its standard error is a t-statistic with a t-distribution. So to know whether an activation in one voxel is significant is relatively straightforward.

If we had just one voxel, we would have computed the t-statistic, and then depending on the degrees of freedom determined if it exceeds the critical value. However, we are doing the same statistical test for MANY voxels. SO the probability that we find a significant voxel simply by chance increases. This is the multiple comparison problem that is encountered anywhere in statistics. In fMRI it is particularly prominent, because the number if singe tests is enormous. There are several ways and philosophies for dealing with it, I won’t go into details right now. The important thing is that any voxel-wise analysis MUST deal with this problem in some way.

## Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis

![](images/clipboard-2858615543.png)

Question: Does the primary visual cortex respond to flickering checkerboards?

::: aside
HCP cortical parcellation ("Glasser atlas") [@glasser2016]
:::

::: notes
ROI analysis is a way to deal with multiple comparison problem. But it requires an a priory and independent definition of an ROI.

There are two ways to define ROIs:

-   From an anatomical scan

-   From an additional (separate) functional experiment
:::

## Subcortical ROIs

::: notes
This is the state-of-the-art for anatomically-based ROI definition based on deep learning
:::

## Multivariate pattern analysis

![](images/clipboard-3955080845.png)

Question: Is the voxel response *pattern* different in condition A and B?

::: notes
Remember that an image is 4d and consists of little 3d cubes called voxels, with the 4th dimension being time. A classical analysis is done over time for every voxel in the brain independently. In a multivariate analysis we first perform a univariate analysis and then look at response patterns of multiple voxels at a time.

In this example, both coca cola and pepsi activate the same 6 voxels in the visual cortex. But the red ones are activated more by cola then by pepsi, and the blue ones the other way around. If you just look at the average response over 6 voxels, you will not see a difference.
:::

## Searchlight analysis

![](images/clipboard-137996085.png)

::: notes
MVPA can be done for a region of interest, or for the entire brain. In the latter case, the brain is subdivided into multiple ROIs, and the relevant analysis is performed for each of them. This procedure is called "searchlight". In this case, MCC is as relevant as it is in a univariate analysis.
