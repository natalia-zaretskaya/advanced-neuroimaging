# Experimental paradigm

In PsychoPy

## Runs

-   chunks of 5-10 minute length

-   one run - one start of the PsychoPy script

## Start screen

-   The script should start by showing a welcome message or instruction reminder

-   It should be waiting for key "5" (scanner "trigger")

-   This is needed to synchronize the fMRI signal acquisition with your paradigm

-   After the start screen, there should be a period of ca. 10 seconds of nothing happening; this is needed to discard initial artifacts

## Subject responses

Subject keys: 1, 2, 3, 4, \[\], 6, 7, 8, 9

## BIDS plugin[^paradigm-2] for PsychoPy

[^paradigm-2]: <https://psychopy-bids.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

Should be installed and enabled to save events (conditions and button presses) in a comprehensive and standardized manner

This will also make our data analysis easier
